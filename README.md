# c-sharp-game-project
### High-level description of this web application
This is a C# game project made under the XNA framework for the Xbox 360. After recieving certification for *Beginning Game Programming with C#*, I developed this game to enhance my skills further in C# and game development. I refined my knowledge in Object Oriented Programming and game design. 

This game is a 2D side-scroller in which you play as the main character, Blackbeard, and kill *scallywags* (enemy pirates) to recieve gold. You can then use this gold at the nearest town to buy items. The game has 7 maps in which you can walk to and from—one of them being the town—with all of the actions and movements being controlled by a connected Xbox 360 controller.

### NOTE: Using game development engines now: Unity
Since the development of this project, I now use Unity and C# to develop my personal game-making projects.
