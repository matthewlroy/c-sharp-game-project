# c-sharp-game-project
### High-level description of this web application
This is a C# game project made under the XNA framework for the Xbox 360. After recieving certification for *Beginning Game Programming with C#*, I developed this game to enhance my skills further in C# and game development. I refined my knowledge in Object Oriented Programming and game design.

### NOTE: Using game development engines now: Unity
Since the development of this project, I now use Unity and C# to develop my personal game-making projects.
