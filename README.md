# c-sharp-game-project
### High-level description of this web application
This is a C# game project made under the XNA framework for the Xbox 360. After recieving certification for *Beginning Game Programming with C#*, I developed this game to enhance my skills further in C# and game development. I refined my knowledge in Object Oriented Programming and game design. 

In this game, you play as the main character, Blackbeard, and attack "scallywags" to recieve gold. You can then use this gold at the nearest town and buy items.

### NOTE: Using game development engines now: Unity
Since the development of this project, I now use Unity and C# to develop my personal game-making projects.
